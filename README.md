# Raspberry Pi Network PC Speaker player
When running a virtual machine, you probably lose the ability to play sound through the host PC Speaker, something that can be both, cool and useful. I used to play PC Speaker tones in [my Synchronet BBS, HispaMSX BBS](https://bbs.hispamsx.org), with the SysOP Pagging feature that trigged the `playtone` binary or [playtone.js](https://gitlab.synchro.net/main/sbbs/-/blob/master/exec/playtone.js?ref_type=heads) file to play [TON files](https://gitlab.synchro.net/main/sbbs/-/tree/master/exec/tone?ref_type=heads) converted from monophonic MIDI files.

I am restoring this feature via a Rasspberry Pi, a PC Speaker connected to PWM enabled GPIO and a small web server coded in Python, so she is able to play tones via HTTP request.

The solution doesn't implement yet the full [TON file syntax](https://gitlab.synchro.net/main/sbbs/-/blob/master/exec/tone/example.ton?ref_type=heads), but many of them will work. Furthermore, as I was not able to get proper sound quality output with [RPi.GPIO Python module](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/), I decided to use [WiringPi gpio command line utility](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi).

# The solution
Following files are part of the solution:

  1. `playtone.bash`. Bash script that plays frequency based TON files using WiringPi `gpio` command line utility.
  2. `rpi-netplaytone.py`. A Python program that brings up a webserver for accepting requests that plays TON files. It calls the `playtone.bash` script.
  3. `rpi-netplaytone.service`. systemd unit file to install the service. **Modify this file `gpio-pin` parameter to match the one you are using in your Raspberry Pi**.
  4. `Makefile`. A simple Makefile to install and uninstall the service. It assumes [systemd](https://systemd.io/) is init.

# Installation
**Please, double-check all parameters and operations for your Raspberry Pi. This software is provided AS IS and I will not take responsability if it causes damage to your PC Speaker, Raspberry Pi board or any other equipment.**

The solution is so simple that there is not an actual installation setup:

  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Install the needed dependencies:
    a. Python 3.9 or higher.
    b. [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi). This should provide the `gpio` command line tool.
    c. `perl5`, `bc`, `tr` and `awk` command line tools.
  3. Edit `rpi-netplaytone.service` and check the gpio pin configuration.
  4. Edit `Makefile` and check the operations it performs are ok with your system, specially `systemd` related setup.
  5. After everything has been checked, run `sudo make install`.

# Uninstall
If you used `sudo make install`, you can uninstall the solution with `sudo make uninstall`.
